**Ikezu-Ishi** (Malicious Rock) is a feudal Japan inspired hack of **Cairn** by Yochai Gal and **Into the Odd** by Chris McDowall. The rules and tables in **Ikezu-Ishi** are meant to help players create a vibrant setting and adventure for one or many play sessions. Players are welcome to adjust, supplement, or ignore any of these elements as they see fit, as long as all players agree on any changes before beginning play.

Throughout this book you’ll find side notes that include examples, clarifications, citations of sources and historical facts, and other information.

While this game is inspired by Japanese mythology and feudal society, it is by no means meant to be a history book and can be quite anachronistic, mixing political and cultural elements from the Kamakura Period (1192-1333) through the Tokugawa (Edo) Period (1603-1868). Efforts have been made to avoid stereotypes, orientalism, and interchanging Asian cultures, though there are some existing historical influences from China, Korea, Mongolia, and other cultures.

Citing this in an academic setting will more than likely result in a terrible outcome, but if you want to play Samurai-ish and hunt Yokai-like creatures in an OSR style game then you’re in the right place.

### On Being Respectfully Inspired

See **Overview and Principles** for more information.

·     Don’t perpetuate stereotypes.

·     Don’t do accents.

·     Don’t obsess over honorifics in speech.

·     Don’t obsess over “honor” as a motivation.
