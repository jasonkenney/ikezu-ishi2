Ikezu-ishi is based on Cairn by Yochai Gal and Into the Odd by Chris McDowall

## Introduction

**Ikezu-Ishi** (Malicious Stone) is a feudal Japan inspired hack of **Cairn** by Yochai Gal and **Into the Odd** by Chris McDowall. The rules and tables in **Ikezu-Ishi** are meant to help players create a vibrant setting and adventure for one or many play sessions. Players are welcome to adjust, supplement, or ignore any of these elements as they see fit, as long as all players agree on any changes before beginning play.

Throughout this book you’ll find sidenotes that include examples, clarifications, citations of sources, and other information.

While this game is inspired by Japanese mythology and feudal society, it is by no means meant to be a historically accurate text. Citing this in an academic setting will more than likely result in a terrible outcome, but if you want to play Samurai-ish and hunt Yokai-like creatures in an OSR style game then you’re in the right place.

### On Being Respectfully Inspired

- Don’t perpetuate stereotypes
- Don’t do accents
- Don’t obsess over honorifics in speech
- Don’t obsess over “honor” as a motivation

# Overview and Principles

## Overview

See **Appendix A** for more Principles for Players and Guides.

**Classless –** A character’s role or skills are defined by the equipment they carry and their experiences, not their class.

**Fiction First –** Dice do not always reflect an obstacle’s difficulty or its outcome. Success and failure are arbitrated by dialogue, based on in-world elements.

**Growth –** Characters are changed through in-world advancement, gaining new skills and abilities by surviving dangerous events and overcoming obstacles.

**Player Choice –** Players should understand the reasons behind their choices, and information about potential risks should be provided freely and frequently.

**Principles** – The Guide and the players have guidelines to help foster a play experience defined by critical thinking, exploration, and an emergent narrative.

## Being respectfully inspired

The following are just a few examples of ways players can be inspired by a setting without devolving into a caricature of bad stereotypes.

**Don’t perpetuate stereotypes**: Research and get to know and enjoy aspects of the culture. Play a fleshed-out character, not an orientalist fantasy.

**Don’t do accents**: Describe how people talk and let your words show the character’s speech.

**Don’t obsess over honorifics in speech:** Over-usage isn’t necessary. If anything, default to degrees of politeness you may use yourself. You speak differently among friends than you do with grandma than you do with the boss.

**Don’t obsess over “honor” as a motivation**: The focus on “duty” and “honor” distills a character to a trope that can quickly be exaggerated. People were not regularly killing themselves or others over the tiniest slights of honor.

## Combat As War

Yes, Sun Tzu was a Chinese general and strategist. While _Ikezu-ishi_ strives to avoid blanket “orientalism,” sometimes a quote is just too good to not use.

To win one hundred victories in one hundred battles is not the acme of skill. To subdue the enemy without fighting is the acme of skill. – Sun Tzu

_There’s no such thing as a clean fight. – Dad_

Combat in this game is not fair, but it is also not inevitable. Guides and players should seek different ways to resolve situations and encounters, using skills, equipment, and storytelling to create their adventure. While combat may not always be avoidable, facing an enemy requires strategizing and trying to stack the odds in your favor – and always be ready to retreat when things go wrong.

# Character Creation

## Roll Ability Scores

**Roll Under System**:

When rolling a save, PCs roll a d20 against an appropriate ability score. If they roll **equal to or under** that ability score, they pass. Otherwise, they fail. A 1 is always a success, and a 20 is always a failure.

Player Characters (PCs) have just three attributes:

**Strength (STR)** Used for saves requiring physical power, like lifting gates, bending bars, resisting poison, etc.

**Dexterity (DEX)** Used for saves requiring poise, speed, and reflexes like dodging, climbing, sneaking, balancing Used, etc.

**Willpower (WIL)** Used for saves to persuade, deceive, interrogate, intimidate, charm, provoke, manipulate, etc.

When creating a PC, the player should roll 3d6 for each of their character's ability scores, in order. They may then swap any two of the results.

## Roll Hit Protection (HP)

Roll 1d6 to determine your PC's starting Hit Protection (HP), which reflects their ability to avoid damage in combat. HP does not indicate a character's health or fortitude; nor do they lose it for very long (see Healing). If an attack takes a PC's HP exactly to 0, the player must roll on the Scars table.

HP can be increased by **Scars** and game play but can never be higher than 3d6.

## Choose a Background

More information is available in the **Backgrounds** chapter (Page 10).

Choose your **Background** or roll 3d6 against the **Background Table** to determine part of your character’s past.

Backgrounds provide flavor to your character. While not a Class, a background helps inform knowledge and skills which may be handy in certain situations. It may also impact interactions within the game.

Background  (3D6)
| Roll | Background | Roll | Background|
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **3** | BANDIT (SANZOKU) | **11** | MINER (KOFU) |
| **4** | BLACKSMITH (KAJI) | **12** | NINJA (SHINOBI) |
| **5** | CARPENTER (DAIKU) | **13** | PERFORMER (GWINOUJIN) |
| **6** | CLERIC (SOURYO) | **14** | PIRATE (KAIZOKU) |
| **7** | GAMBLER (TOBAKUSHI) | **15** | RONIN (RONIN) |
| **8** | HERBALIST (KUSUSHI) | **16** | SAMURAI (SAMURAI) |
| **9** | HUNTER (YAKUZAISHI) | **17** | SERVANT (KERAI) |
| **10** | MERCHANT (GYOUSHA) | **18** | SOLDIER (ASHIGARU) |

## Starting Gear

All PCs begin with a kate-bukuro (provision bag) with six slots and the Starting Gear listed in the character’s **Background**. The Guide may allow players to select their gear from the Equipment Tables (Page 19)

## Inventory

Characters have a total of 10 inventory slots:

- six slots in a kate-bukuro
- one slot for each hand
- two slots for their upper body

Most items take up one slot, and small items can be bundled together. Slots are abstract and can be rearranged per the Guide's discretion.

**Bulky** items take up two slots and are typically two-handed or awkward to carry.

Anyone carrying a full inventory (e.g. filling all 10 slots) is reduced to 0 HP.

A character cannot carry more items than their inventory allows. Carts (which must be pulled with both hands), horses, or mules can increase inventory. **Retainers** can also be paid to carry equipment.

## Finishing Touches

Roll your character’s **Age** (2d20+10).

Players may fill out the rest of their character sheets as they see fit, or by using the following tables. These have no impact on the rules of the game but can be used for further developing characters and by Guides for creating plot threads.
